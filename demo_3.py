# This third demo shows how a robot swarm can autonomously choose an open curve shape and form
# the shape in a distributed way. This simulation shares the same strategy with second demo in
# organizing the robots, but it needs no role assignment on the open curve.

# Description:
# Starting dispersed in random positions, the swarm aggregates together to form a straight line
# with the merging method. From here, the following steps run repeatedly. The robots first make
# collective decision of which open curve shape to form, then adjust the local shapes so the
# curve reshapes to the target shape.
