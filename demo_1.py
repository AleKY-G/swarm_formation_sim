# This first demo shows how a robot swarm can autonomously choose a loop shape and form the
# shape in a distributed manner, without central control. Two consensus processes, decision
# making and role assignment, are performed consecutively with a fixed but arbitrary network.

# Description:
# Starting dispersed in random positions, the swarm aggregates together arbitrarily to form
# a connected network. Consensus decision making is performed with this network fixed, making
# a collective decision of which loop the swarm should form. Then with the same network, role
# assignment is performed, assigning the target positions to each robot. After these two
# consensus processes are done, the swarm disperses and aggregates again, this time aiming to
# form a loop with robots at their designated positions. The climbing method is used to permutate
# the robots on the loop. When the robots get their target positions, they dyanmically adjust
# the local shape so the loop deforms to the target one. The above steps will be ran repeatedly.

# Note that message transmission is simulated only in the role assignment, because communication
# is specialy depended on and message convey is used as well. While in consensus decision making
# and shape formation, the delay caused by communication are skipped.



# add interaction of mouse to show further interaction

# use text update in the terminal to show extra information, iterations

# when to terminate a process and continue next one
# consensus decision making -> subgroup size reaches to total number
# role assignment -> when there is no conflict
# loop formation -> when local shape accuracy is within a threshold

# the use of colors
# consensus decision making: same color for same chosen decision, of collective shape
    # guarantee all robots agreed on one choice
# role assignment: same color for same chosen decision, of target position
    # guarantee all robots agreed on all different choices
# loop formation: no colors, empty circle for dormant, filled circle for active
