# static version of the probabilistic approach for the loop reshape formation



# need two polygons, one for initial setup formation, one for target formation
# have the algorithm for this first, no matter in which graphic window

# the basic requirements:
# equal space polygon, concave is allowed
# no collapse inside, any pair of non-neighbor robots should not be closer than loop space


# mouse click to select? or just show all of them (preferred)

# plot histogram with matplotlib
