# swarm_formation_sim
Line formation simulation for swarm robots using climbing method and competing mechanism, graphics is done with pygame.

Line formation simulation, the requirements for the robots: basic wireless communication, limited communication range, direction and distance sensing of a robot in range, robot modeled as dot so no collision avoidance necessary, omnidirection movement, homeogeneous robots. The algorithm will rely heavily on communication to update robot's knowledge when running on real robots. More details about the algorithm can be found in the comments in "line_formation.py".
