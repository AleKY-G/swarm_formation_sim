# swarm_formation_sim
Line formation simulation, the basics for the robots are: wireless communication capability, limited communication range, direction and distance sensing of a neighbor in range, robot modeled as dot so no collision avoidance, omnidirection movement, homeogeneous robots.

Simulation will heavily rely on communication to update the knowledge of each robot.
